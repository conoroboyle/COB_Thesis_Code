This repository contains the Modelica code used and described in the PhD Thesis
  "Modelling and development of efficient ventilation strategies to ensure bus passengersâ€™ thermal comfort whilst minimising energy consumption"
by Conor O'Boyle (2024).

This repository contains models for assessing the human physiological responses to different environments, and their psychological thermal sensation & comfort levels.
The models have been implemented by the author in Modelica to allow for integration into co-simulations with ANSYS Fluent analyses (via ANSYS TwinBuilder).

The models are based on published models available in literature (original publications are linked within the code).
These implentations have been verified as producing results which are in-line with the original models:
  this has been achieved by comparing their outputs to the original validation results from experimental testing.

Further information on the model creation, implementation, and use can be found in the Conor O'Boyle's PhD Thesis.
